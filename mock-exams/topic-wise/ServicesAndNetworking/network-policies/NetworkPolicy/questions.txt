CKAD NetworkPolicy Practice Questions
Question 1: Deny All Ingress
Create a NetworkPolicy named deny-all in namespace prod that denies all incoming traffic to all pods.
Question 2: Allow from Specific Pods
Create a NetworkPolicy named backend-policy that:

Applies to pods with label app=backend
Allows ingress from pods with label app=frontend on port 8080
Denies all other ingress traffic

Question 3: Allow from Specific Namespace
Create a NetworkPolicy named db-access that:

Applies to pods with label app=database
Allows ingress only from pods in namespace app-namespace on port 3306
Denies all other traffic

Question 4: Egress Control
Create a NetworkPolicy named frontend-egress that:

Applies to pods with label app=frontend
Allows egress to pods with label app=backend on port 8080
Allows egress to DNS (port 53 UDP)
Denies all other egress

Question 5: Multiple Port Rules
Create a NetworkPolicy named web-policy that:

Applies to pods with label tier=web
Allows ingress on port 80 and 443 from any pod
Denies all other ingress

Question 6: Namespace + Pod Selector
Create a NetworkPolicy named api-policy that:

Applies to pods with label app=api
Allows ingress from pods with label role=backend in namespace services
Allows ingress from pods with label role=admin in any namespace
Denies all other traffic

Question 7: Default Deny Egress
Create a NetworkPolicy named deny-egress in namespace secure that denies all outgoing traffic 
from all pods.
Question 8: Allow Specific IP Block
Create a NetworkPolicy named external-access that:

Applies to pods with label app=web
Allows ingress from CIDR block 192.168.1.0/24 on port 80
Denies ingress from 192.168.1.5/32 (exception)

Question 9: Ingress and Egress Combined
Create a NetworkPolicy named full-policy that:

Applies to pods with label app=microservice
Allows ingress from pods with label app=frontend on port 8080
Allows egress to pods with label app=database on port 5432
Allows egress to DNS

Question 10: Troubleshooting
A NetworkPolicy exists but pods can't communicate. Debug by:

Checking if CNI plugin supports NetworkPolicies
Verifying pod labels match policy selectors
Testing connectivity before/after applying policy
Checking policy rules syntax

These match CKAD difficulty - you need to write valid NetworkPolicy YAML quickly.
